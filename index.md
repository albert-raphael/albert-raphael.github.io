[Sales Trends and Patterns: An Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/albert-raphael/albert-raphael.github.io/blob/master/pdf/Sales%20Trends%20and%20Patterns%20An%20Exploratory%20Data_zerotopandas-course-project.pdf)

Analyzed sales data 2015-2016  using Python and Pandas to gain insights into the trends and patterns of sales over time. The sales dataset contains information on transactions, including the products sold, their cost and revenue, and the volume of products sold. It also includes customer age, gender, and location, offering insights into purchasing behavior across different demographic groups.
In performing this analysis, I used Python and the Pandas library, which provides powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis. I also use Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

[Firms Export Activities And The Adoption of Environmental Actions in High- And Low-Income Countries](/pdf/Firms%20Export%20Activities%20And%20The%20Adoption%20of%20Environmental%20Actions%20in%20High.pdf)

This paper examines the relationship between the export activities of firms in the manufacturing and service sector and the adoption of environmental actions in high- and low-income countries. Using multi-country data at the level of the firms, the empirical results show that firms involved in international trade are more likely to adopt the tools of green management in their production processes. Based on the heterogeneity of countries used in this study, I provide evidence that firms involved in export activities in low-income countries are likely to adopt green management techniques compared to firms that export in high-income countries. Taken together, the results suggest that export activities can significantly hasten the pace of green economic transformation by the countries involved.

[Innovation And Firm Growth](/pdf/INNOVATION%20AND%20FIRM%20GROWTH.pdf)

The role of innovation to the development of a modern economy cannot be overemphasis. Innovative activity is the main driver of economic evolution, sustainability and the rise in the living standards in any society.Hence, this seminar paper arguments and analysis centred on previous works by academics scholars and empirical evidence that substantiated the role of innovation as a determinant of firm growth.
